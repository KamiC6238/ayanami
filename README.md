# About this project
It's a free online pixel art drawing tool. Feel free to share your drawing with me at [danzzzzsama@gmail.com](mailto:danzzzzsama@gmail.com) — I’d love to feature it on a special website!

## Why I made it?
I bought [Octopath Traveler II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II) in 2024. The game’s scenery captivated me, and at that moment, a thought came to mind: maybe I could make a pixel art tool by myself one day.

After the idea took root, I started looking for pixel art editors in the community and eventually discovered [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
I was inspired by its color design and began developing my own pixel art editor.
It’s not perfect yet, but I’ll keep improving it—step by step—until it becomes what I envisioned.

Lately, I’ve also been playing [Stardew Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley) in my free time.

## 🙏 Special Thanks
Huge thanks to [Luke Morrigan](https://github.com/CodeFoodPixels) for [Pixel-Corners](https://github.com/CodeFoodPixels/pixel-corners), which helped me implement beautiful pixel-style UI components.
