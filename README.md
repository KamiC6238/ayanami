# About this project
It's a free online pixel art editor.

## Why I made it?
I bought [Octopath Traveler II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopath_Traveler_II) in 2024. The gameâ€™s scenery captivated me, and at that moment, a thought came to mind: maybe I could make a pixel art tool by myself one day.

After the idea took root, I started looking for pixel art editors in the community and eventually discovered [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
I was inspired by its color design and began developing my own pixel art editor.
Itâ€™s not perfect yet, but Iâ€™ll keep improving itâ€”step by stepâ€”until it becomes what I envisioned.

Lately, Iâ€™ve also been playing [Stardew Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley) in my free time.
